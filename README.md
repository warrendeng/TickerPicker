# Ticker Picker
Ticker Picker is an application that recommends what to do with a stock based on previous market data and sentiment analysis on Tweets related to that stock. The core of our application is a recurrent neural network which is trained on old market data from the Goldman Sachs Marquee API. The neural network combines this data with additional information from sentiment analysis that we ran on the top tweets of the stock name using Google's Cloud Natural Language API and Twitter's Standard API. The output of the neural network is fed through a softmax function which ultimately classifies the stock into one of three categories: buy, hold, or sell. The Marquee API that was provided to us only had data up to 2017, but we hope that with more current data, our application would better predict how a stock will trend. The functionality of the programming is currently unavaliable because our Hackathon API tokens have expired.
